      <description>Welcome to jwillikers.com, an archive for all of my tech experiments, configurations, and adventures. I hope that you will find something helpful here, something that will make your life a little easier as a developer, system administrator, or self-hoster.
   Me This is my website, so I get to talk about myself right?
 On-the-job Current At my current day job, I wrangle C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; and CMake code to create functioning, cross-platform graphical applications.</description>

      <description>Some ISP&amp;#8217;s establish connections with their customers&#39; networks through PPPoE. I recently setup an OpenBSD 6.6 router which required PPPoE. This is my story.
   DNS Servers If necessary, configure your system to use your preferred DNS nameservers.
     A common way of connecting to your ISP&amp;#8217;s network is through DHCP. DHCP is capable of providing your system with DNS nameservers according to RFC 2132 and RFC 2937.</description>
