    <description><![CDATA[Configuring IPv6 on my OpenBSD home router was a much more difficult task than I&#8217;d expected. While this was mostly due to the steep learning curve of IPv6 and DHCPv6, OpenBSD doesn&#8217;t provide DHCPv6 support in its native DHCP daemon. I&#8217;ve documented my setup and difficulties here in the hope it saves some time for someone else.
ConfigurationI configured IPv6 on on my home router running OpenBSD 6.7.

    <description><![CDATA[Blocking connections to nefarious IP addresses in your firewall is usually a good idea. On OpenBSD, the pf-badhost script updates PF to block traffic to and from such addresses. This post walks through my installation and verification of pf-badhost. Make sure to check out the well-written installation instructions, too.
ConfigureDownload the pf-badhost.sh script.
ftp https://www.geoghegan.ca/scripts/pf-badhost.sh Install the script with the appropriate permissions.
install -g bin -m 644 -o root pf-badhost.sh /usr/local/bin/ 1 The script will be owned by root, belong to the bin group, and be readable by everyone and writeable by the owner.]]></description>
