    <description><![CDATA[Typing a password to login is repetitive enough, isn&#8217;t it? Entering the password for Sudo on the command-line can be downright irritating. If you don&#8217;t need that extra bit of protection, why enter your password more than you have to?[1] You can forever skip entering your sudo password, and it&#8217;s super easy and cross-platform. For whatever reason, I learned and forgot about doing this sometime ago, so here&#8217;s the gist.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The Focal Fossa nestles in on Santa Catalina Island  Recently, I discovered that the Linux hypervisor, QEMU, is available on macOS. This is particularly exciting because I have to spin-up Linux VMs on macs at my day job, and I&#8217;ve wanted to get some more hands-on experience with QEMU. QEMU runs VMs quite efficiently and provides a robust set of tools for creating, managing, and running virtual machines. Additionally, it&#8217;s open-source and not controlled by Oracle.]]></description>
