      <description>Ever want to enable DNSSEC on your Unbound OpenBSD 6.6 server? Me too! Using this article as a guide, I document the process.
   Unbound Configuration Use the ftp command to download the Root Hints.
 ftp -o /var/unbound/etc/root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root   Download the trust anchor file with the unbound-anchor utility.
 unbound-anchor   Configure unbound.conf. Add the location of the root.hints file and uncomment the lines with the keys auto-trust-anchor-file and val-log-level.</description>

      <description>Ever want to get rid of all those annoying internet ads? Me too. I&amp;#8217;d been planning on using something like Pi-hole, but recently stumbled upon unbound-adblock, which is perfect for my OpenBSD home router. The setup is very well-documented there, but I provide my own, slightly-modified setup instructions here. Most notably, the cron-job runs at 6:30 AM, not midnight, and I refined the PF rule which redirects DNS requests to Google&amp;#8217;s DNS servers.</description>

      <title>PPPoE on OpenBSD</title>

      <description>Some ISP&amp;#8217;s establish connections with their customers&#39; networks through PPPoE. I recently setup an OpenBSD 6.6 router which required PPPoE. This is my story.
   DNS Servers If necessary, configure your system to use your preferred DNS nameservers.
     A common way of connecting to your ISP&amp;#8217;s network is through DHCP. DHCP is capable of providing your system with DNS nameservers according to RFC 2132 and RFC 2937.</description>
