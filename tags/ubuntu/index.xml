      <description>OpenWrt is an open-source router firmware solution based off of the Linux kernel. There are many reasons to use OpenWrt. I finally replaced the default RouterOS installation on my MikroTik RB750r2 (hEX lite) router with OpenWrt. Unfortunately, this took longer than it should have because of the difficulty I had finding the right install locations on the OpenWrt website. The website is a bit cluttered with odds and ends of installation instructions throughout.</description>

      <description>It is handy to have your system send you an email alert if it detects an issue or potential security risk. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;#8217;t always straightforward, especially if you want to send an email from your desktop computer. Sending an email directly from your desktop to your email provider is likely going to accomplish absolutely nothing. The email will likely be blocked since it is from an unknown source, i.e. your desktop.</description>
