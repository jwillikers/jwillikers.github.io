      <description>I enjoy the Solarized color scheme, so I figured out how to set it up in Vim. The Solarized color scheme provides a plugin for Vim, which makes this pretty straightfoward. The following instructions detail how to do this on Ubuntu 20.04, but other than the installation step, this should work on any Unix-like system so long as Vim is at least version eight. This guide assumes you are familiar with installing packages from the command-line on Ubuntu, git, configuring Vim, and using Vim packages.</description>

      <title>Switch to fish</title>

      <description>I’ve finally made the switch from ZSH to the fish shell. Unlike ZSH, I don’t need to install and manage a whole host of plugins. Everything I want comes packaged right in as part of the shell itself.
The SwitchIn this post, I describe how to switch to the fish shell and some of the interesting features it offers.
InstallInstalling fish is a piece of cake. On Ubuntu, a fish package is readily available.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, you just want to switch to a better shell for your terminal - like fish.
TutorialHere’s a quick run through of how to change your default login shell which assumes you understand the basics of the command-line on Unix-like systems. These instructions are exemplified on an Ubuntu 20.04 system for the fish shell but this works just the same for any shell on *BSD, Linux, and macOS.
Install the fish package.</description>

      <description>There’s a catch when it comes to managing plugins with Antigen as done in Configure ZSH.
According to the Antigen documentation: This is something you might not want to put in your .zshrc. Instead, run it occasionally to update your plugins.
— Antigen Wiki: Commands - antigen update I hate having to do any form of maintenance occasionally, especially simple maintenance. This has two potential outcomes:
Completely forget to do it ever.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using ZSH for years now as my shell. In that time, I’ve learned a few niceties to make the experience better. Namely, I’ve found the minimal oh-my-zsh prompt keeps out of the way and the git aliases super convenient. Plugins for autosuggestions, like in the fish shell, and syntax highlighting are also quite helpful. Antigen makes keeping plugins up-to-date a breeze.
TutorialThis tutorial explains how to install ZSH and set it as your default shell on Ubuntu 20.</description>

      <description>It’s Always Greener on the MATE Side  While I was working on my recent post Virtualize Ubuntu Desktop on macOS with QEMU, I came across Canonical’s Multipass utility. Multipass makes it extremely simple to spin up Ubuntu instances on the fly whether your on Linux, macOS, and Windows. While your VM may not be as speedy as with QEMU, I would be remiss for not doing a quick write-up on this tool which makes it so easy to get up and running.</description>

      <description>The Focal Fossa nestles in on Santa Catalina Island  Recently, I discovered that the Linux hypervisor, QEMU, is available on macOS. This is particularly exciting because I have to spin-up Linux VMs on macs at my day job, and I’ve wanted to get some more hands-on experience with QEMU. QEMU runs VMs quite efficiently and provides a robust set of tools for creating, managing, and running virtual machines. Additionally, it’s open-source and not controlled by Oracle.</description>

      <description>Backups are super helpful, especially when you like to blow everything away fairly often. Backing up the data from a Docker container can help you quickly get things up and running again.
TutorialMy recent post detailed how to setup a UniFi Controller in a Docker container. This tutorial uses that container as an example for creating and restoring backups of data volumes.
BackupCreating backups is done by producing an archive of the important files on the host filesystem from the container’s data volume.</description>

      <description>For wi-fi, I use use a UniFi AP. One slightly annoying aspect of this is the UniFi Controller. If you don’t have a smartphone or need to manage more than one device, you’ll need to set one up. I provide a brief tutorial for setting up the UniFi Controller with Docker Compose here.
TutorialAn existing Docker image makes setting up the UniFi Controller a breeze. Here’s how.
Install DockerFirst, you must install Docker on your system.</description>

      <description>I recently fixed my mother-in-law’s laptop. Long story short, the hard disk was toast. When I repaired the computer, I decided it would be best to avoid the frustration and confusion of a failing hard drive in the future. So, how does one know if his or her mother-in-law’s hard disk is reaching senility? SmartMonTools appears to be the best tool for the job. It’s a tool for monitoring and reporting hard disk health with Self-Monitoring, Anlysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) which is built into most hard drives.</description>

      <description>It can be handy to have your system email you if it detects an issue or potential security risk. Unfortunately, this isn’t always straightforward, especially when you want to send an email from your desktop computer. Sending an email directly from your desktop to your email account is likely going to accomplish nothing. The email will likely be blocked since, to your email provider, it is from an unknown source. I ran into this problem recently trying to set up SmartMonTools to send an email when it detected hard drive errors.</description>
