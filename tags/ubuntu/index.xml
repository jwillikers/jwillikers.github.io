      <description>Installing Docker on Ubuntu should be easy, right? Turns out yes&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; but only if you go about it the right way.
   The Right (Easy) Way Save yourself some hassle by installing Docker as packaged per your version of Ubuntu. I use docker-compose, and installing its package with apt also installs Docker.
 $apt install docker-compose   If you just want to install Docker without docker-compose, install the docker.</description>

      <description>For wi-fi, I use use a UniFi AP. One slightly annoying aspect of this the UniFi Controller. If you don&amp;#8217;t have a smartphone or need to manage more than one device, you&amp;#8217;ll need to set one up. I provide a brief tutorial for setting up the UniFi Controller with Docker Compose here.
   Tutorial An existing Docker image makes setting up the UniFi Controller a breeze. Here&amp;#8217;s how.</description>

      <title>Automatically Detect &amp; Report Hard Drive Failure</title>

      <description>I recently fixed my mother-in-law&amp;#8217;s laptop. Long story short, the hard disk was toast. When I repaired the computer, I decided it would be best to avoid the frustration and confusion of a failing hard drive in the future. So, how does one know if his or her mother-in-law&amp;#8217;s hard disk is reaching senility? SmartMonTools appears to be the best tool for the job. It&amp;#8217;s a tool for monitoring and reporting hard disk health with Self-Monitoring, Anlysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) which is built into most hard drives.</description>

      <description>It can be handy to have your system email you if it detects an issue or potential security risk. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;#8217;t always straightforward, especially when you want to send an email from your desktop computer. Sending an email directly from your desktop to your email account is likely going to accomplish nothing. The email will likely be blocked since, to your email provider, it is from an unknown source. I ran into this problem recently trying to set up SmartMonTools to send an email when it detected hard drive errors.</description>
