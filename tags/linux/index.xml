      <description>Sometimes, you just want to switch to a better shell for your terminal - like fish.
TutorialHere&amp;#8217;s a quick run through of how to change your default login shell which assumes you understand the basics of the command-line on Unix-like systems. These instructions are exemplified on an Ubuntu 20.04 system for the fish shell but this works just the same for any shell on *BSD, Linux, and macOS.
Install the fish package.</description>

      <description>The OpenSSH client and server applications are ubiquitous. Like many a software dev, I&amp;#8217;m `ssh&amp;#8217;ing all over the place. And you know what? I&amp;#8217;ve put off learning the ins and outs of its configuration for far too long. I learned that a little bit of know-how can simplify my day-to-day use of SSH. That&amp;#8217;s exactly why I&amp;#8217;ve written this post to exemplify the configuration options I&amp;#8217;m now using.

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a catch when it comes to managing plugins with Antigen as done in Configure ZSH.
According to the Antigen documentation: This is something you might not want to put in your .zshrc. Instead, run it occasionally to update your plugins.
&amp;#8212; Antigen Wiki: Commands - antigen update I hate having to do any form of maintenance occasionally, especially simple maintenance. This has two potential outcomes:
Completely forget to do it ever.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using ZSH for years now as my shell. In that time, I&amp;#8217;ve learned a few niceties to make the experience better. Namely, I&amp;#8217;ve found the minimal oh-my-zsh prompt keeps out of the way and the git aliases super convenient. Plugins for autosuggestions, like in the fish shell, and syntax highlighting are also quite helpful. Antigen makes keeping plugins up-to-date a breeze.
TutorialThis tutorial explains how to install ZSH and set it as your default shell on Ubuntu 20.</description>

      <description>Typing a password to login is repetitive enough, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Entering the password for Sudo on the command-line can be downright irritating. If you don&amp;#8217;t need that extra bit of protection, why enter your password more than you have to?[1] You can forever skip entering your sudo password, and it&amp;#8217;s super easy and cross-platform. For whatever reason, I learned and forgot about doing this sometime ago, so here&amp;#8217;s the gist.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Always Greener on the MATE Side  While I was working on my recent post Virtualize Ubuntu Desktop on macOS with QEMU, I came across Canonical&amp;#8217;s Multipass utility. Multipass makes it extremely simple to spin up Ubuntu instances on the fly whether your on Linux, macOS, and Windows. While your VM may not be as speedy as with QEMU, I would be remiss for not doing a quick write-up on this tool which makes it so easy to get up and running.</description>

      <description>The Focal Fossa nestles in on Santa Catalina Island  Recently, I discovered that the Linux hypervisor, QEMU, is available on macOS. This is particularly exciting because I have to spin-up Linux VMs on macs at my day job, and I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to get some more hands-on experience with QEMU. QEMU runs VMs quite efficiently and provides a robust set of tools for creating, managing, and running virtual machines. Additionally, it&amp;#8217;s open-source and not controlled by Oracle.</description>

      <title>Update U-Boot on the PinePhone</title>

      <description>As I big fan of GNOME, I really wanted a similar experience on the PinePhone. That&amp;#8217;s why I opted for running Manjaro ARM&#39;s alpha for the PinePhone, which comes in a GNOME-like Phosh flavor. It&amp;#8217;s been running from the SD card great so far, but I thought to update the internal U-Boot as I did on the Pinebook Pro.
TutorialThis tutorial provides instructions for updating the PinePhone&amp;#8217;s bootloader from Manjaro running off of a microSD card.</description>

      <description>The other day, Elementary announced elementaryOS 6 preview builds for the Pinebook Pro. I went ahead and flashed an SD card with a build image to try it out. Instead of booting to elmentaryOS on the SD card as the system should have, it booted to Manjaro. While a quick restart from Manjaro caused the system to boot from the SD card, I figured it must be time to upgrade the bootloader, U-Boot.</description>

      <title>External Storage on the Pinebook Pro with ZFS</title>

      <description>Note: This tutorial is out-of-date and will be updated when I get ZFS working again on the Pinebook Pro.
 The Pinebook Pro comes with a small amount of internal disk space, only 64 GB. While this is upgradeable to 128 GB, that still isn&amp;#8217;t enough for those with large media collections. The easiest solution is to use a microSD card. And now you&amp;#8217;re just dying to use ZFS on that, right?</description>

      <description>Backups are super helpful, especially when you like to blow everything away fairly often. Backing up the data from a Docker container can help you quickly get things up and running again.
TutorialMy recent post detailed how to setup a UniFi Controller in a Docker container. This tutorial uses that container as an example for creating and restoring backups of data volumes.
BackupCreating backups is done by producing an archive of the important files on the host filesystem from the container&amp;#8217;s data volume.</description>

      <description>Recently, I obtained a 64-bit ARM, budget Linux laptop, the Pinebook Pro. It&amp;#8217;s a wonderful, sleek little notebook, boasting great convenience and power-efficiency. I enjoy using it so much, it&amp;#8217;s becoming my main machine, and I&amp;#8217;d love love to put all of my music, audiobooks, pictures, and ebooks on it. The only problem being my media takes up a bit more than the 64 GiB available on the machine&amp;#8217;s built-in eMMC.</description>

      <description>For wi-fi, I use use a UniFi AP. One slightly annoying aspect of this is the UniFi Controller. If you don&amp;#8217;t have a smartphone or need to manage more than one device, you&amp;#8217;ll need to set one up. I provide a brief tutorial for setting up the UniFi Controller with Docker Compose here.
TutorialAn existing Docker image makes setting up the UniFi Controller a breeze. Here&amp;#8217;s how.
Install DockerFirst, you must install Docker on your system.</description>

      <description>I recently fixed my mother-in-law&amp;#8217;s laptop. Long story short, the hard disk was toast. When I repaired the computer, I decided it would be best to avoid the frustration and confusion of a failing hard drive in the future. So, how does one know if his or her mother-in-law&amp;#8217;s hard disk is reaching senility? SmartMonTools appears to be the best tool for the job. It&amp;#8217;s a tool for monitoring and reporting hard disk health with Self-Monitoring, Anlysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) which is built into most hard drives.</description>

      <description>It can be handy to have your system email you if it detects an issue or potential security risk. Unfortunately, this isn&amp;#8217;t always straightforward, especially when you want to send an email from your desktop computer. Sending an email directly from your desktop to your email account is likely going to accomplish nothing. The email will likely be blocked since, to your email provider, it is from an unknown source. I ran into this problem recently trying to set up SmartMonTools to send an email when it detected hard drive errors.</description>
