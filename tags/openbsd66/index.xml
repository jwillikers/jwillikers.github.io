      <description>Ever want to enable DNSSEC on your Unbound OpenBSD 6.6 server? Me too! Using this article as a guide, I document the process.
Unbound ConfigurationUse the ftp command to download the Root Hints.
ftp -o /var/unbound/etc/root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root Download the trust anchor file with the unbound-anchor utility.
unbound-anchor Configure unbound.conf. Add the location of the root.hints file and uncomment the lines with the keys auto-trust-anchor-file and val-log-level.
/var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf # Uncomment to enable DNSSEC validation.</description>

      <title>PPPoE on OpenBSD</title>

      <description>Some ISP&amp;#8217;s establish connections with their customers&#39; networks through PPPoE. I recently setup an OpenBSD 6.6 router which required PPPoE. This is my story.
DNS ServersIf necessary, configure your system to use your preferred DNS nameservers.
Tip: A common way of connecting to your ISP&amp;#8217;s network is through DHCP. DHCP is capable of providing your system with DNS nameservers according to RFC 2132 and RFC 2937. To my knowledge, this capability is absent from the PPPoE Specification.</description>
