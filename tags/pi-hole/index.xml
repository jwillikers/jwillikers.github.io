      <description>Ever want to get rid of all those annoying internet ads? Me too. I&amp;#8217;d been planning on using something like Pi-hole, but recently stumbled upon unbound-adblock, which is perfect for my OpenBSD home router. The setup is very well-documented there, but I provide my own, slightly-modified setup instructions here. Most notably, the cron-job runs at 6:30 AM, not midnight, and I refined the PF rule which redirects DNS requests to Google&amp;#8217;s DNS servers.</description>
