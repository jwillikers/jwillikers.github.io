      <description>Recently, Firefox announced it&amp;#8217;s roll-out of DNS over HTTPS (DoH). That made me think, &#34;Encrypting DNS&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; Why don&amp;#8217;t I do that for my home network?&#34; Well, I&amp;#8217;ve now had the opportunity to configure my Unbound DNS resolver to encrypt it&amp;#8217;s DNS requests. Unbound has support built-in for DoH&amp;#8217;s sibling protocol, DNS over TLS (DoT). Instead of encrypting DNS traffic and masking it as standard HTTPS traffic, it uses the dedicated port 853.</description>

      <description>Ever want to enable DNSSEC on your Unbound OpenBSD 6.6 server? Me too! Using this article as a guide, I document the process.
Unbound ConfigurationUse the ftp command to download the Root Hints.
ftp -o /var/unbound/etc/root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root Download the trust anchor file with the unbound-anchor utility.
unbound-anchor Configure unbound.conf. Add the location of the root.hints file and uncomment the lines with the keys auto-trust-anchor-file and val-log-level.
/var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf # Uncomment to enable DNSSEC validation.</description>

      <description>Ever want to get rid of all those annoying internet ads? Me too. I&amp;#8217;d been planning on using something like Pi-hole, but recently stumbled upon unbound-adblock, which is perfect for my OpenBSD home router. The setup is very well-documented there, but I provide my own, slightly-modified setup instructions here. Most notably, the cron-job runs at 6:30 AM, not midnight, and I refined the PF rule which redirects DNS requests to Google&amp;#8217;s DNS servers.</description>
