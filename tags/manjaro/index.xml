    <description><![CDATA[As I big fan of GNOME, I really wanted a similar experience on the PinePhone. That&#8217;s why I opted for running Manjaro ARM's alpha for the PinePhone, which comes in a GNOME-like Phosh flavor. It&#8217;s been running from the SD card great so far, but I thought to update the internal U-Boot as I did on the Pinebook Pro.
TutorialThis tutorial provides instructions for updating the PinePhone&#8217;s bootloader from Manjaro running off of a microSD card.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The other day, Elementary announced elementaryOS 6 preview builds for the Pinebook Pro. I went ahead and flashed an SD card with a build image to try it out. Instead of booting to elmentaryOS on the SD card as the system should have, it booted to Manjaro. While a quick restart from Manjaro caused the system to boot from the SD card, I figured it must be time to upgrade the bootloader, U-Boot.]]></description>

    <title>External Storage on the Pinebook Pro with ZFS</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Note: This tutorial is out-of-date and will be updated when I get ZFS working again on the Pinebook Pro.
 The Pinebook Pro comes with a small amount of internal disk space, only 64 GB. While this is upgradeable to 128 GB, that still isn&#8217;t enough for those with large media collections. The easiest solution is to use a microSD card. And now you&#8217;re just dying to use ZFS on that, right?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Recently, I obtained a 64-bit ARM, budget Linux laptop, the Pinebook Pro. It&#8217;s a wonderful, sleek little notebook, boasting great convenience and power-efficiency. I enjoy using it so much, it&#8217;s becoming my main machine, and I&#8217;d love love to put all of my music, audiobooks, pictures, and ebooks on it. The only problem being my media takes up a bit more than the 64 GiB available on the machine&#8217;s built-in eMMC.]]></description>
