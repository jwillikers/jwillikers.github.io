      <description>The Pinebook Pro comes with a small amount of internal disk space, only 64 GB. While this is upgradeable to 128 GB, that still isn&amp;#8217;t enough for those with large media collections. The easiest solution is to use a microSD card. And now you&amp;#8217;re just dying to use ZFS on that, right?
 TutorialFollowing the previous post, Install ZFS on the Pinebook Pro, this tutorial describes the steps required to setup a microSD card for your music files with ZFS on the Pinebook Pro.</description>

      <description>Backups are super helpful, especially when you like to blow everything away fairly often. Backing up the data from a Docker container can help you quickly get things up and running again.
 TutorialMy recent post detailed how to setup a UniFi Controller in a Docker container. This tutorial uses that container as an example for creating and restoring backups of data volumes.
BackupCreating backups is done by producing an archive of the important files on the host filesystem from the container&amp;#8217;s data volume.</description>

      <description>Recently, I obtained a 64-bit ARM, budget Linux laptop, the Pinebook Pro. It&amp;#8217;s a wonderful, sleek little notebook, boasting great convenience and power-efficiency. I enjoy using it so much, it&amp;#8217;s becoming my main machine, and I&amp;#8217;d love love to put all of my music, audiobooks, pictures, and ebooks on it. The only problem being my media takes up a bit more than the 64 GiB available on the machine&amp;#8217;s built-in eMMC.</description>

      <description>I recently fixed my mother-in-law&amp;#8217;s laptop. Long story short, the hard disk was toast. When I repaired the computer, I decided it would be best to avoid the frustration and confusion of a failing hard drive in the future. So, how does one know if his or her mother-in-law&amp;#8217;s hard disk is reaching senility? SmartMonTools appears to be the best tool for the job. It&amp;#8217;s a tool for monitoring and reporting hard disk health with Self-Monitoring, Anlysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) which is built into most hard drives.</description>
